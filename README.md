# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in finding out more about stack overflow usage and community participation using the Stack Overflow 2020 questionnaire conducted by stack overflow. This project answered some questions bothering on how welcome respondents felt compared to the previous year, their preference on relaxation of restrictions on off-topic, the precentage of respondents with stack over flow account and those that see themselves as a member of the stack overflow community.
Additionally, I assess the percentage of the respondents who uses stack overflow as an option when stucked
